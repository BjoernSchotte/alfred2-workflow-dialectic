alfred2-workflow-dialectic
==========================

Alfred2 workflow for dialing with the [dialectic](http://www.jonn8.com/dialectic/) utility which itself connects to a SIP/softphone like Skype or Bria.

Features
========

This workflow supports dialing contacts from your address book through Alfred2's Contact view. It requires that you set a "Custom Action" in Features/Contacts for the "Phone" field of the address book.

You can also call a number through the keyword "dial <number>".

Prerequisites
=============

* pre-configured and working dialectic routing to your favourite softphone (I use Bria 3)

Installation
============

* download [Alfred2 workflow file](Dial with Dialectic.alfredworkflow)
* import it into Alfred2 workflow (you need Alfred2 Power Pack for this)
* set "Phone" field pointing to this workflow in Features/Contacts in the Alfred2 preferences
* have fun and dial :-)
